# How to set up and use
1. Just open `setup.bat` and let it do its thing. Once it says it's done you may close the window.
2. Paste your Discord token into the "token" field in `config.json`. If you do not know how to get your token, just follow the instructions at https://github.com/TheRacingLion/Discord-SelfBot/wiki/Discord-Token-Tutorial. Your config file should look like `"token": "yourtokenhere"`.
3. Open `run.bat` and enjoy!
